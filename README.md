## [Git Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

This article talks about some conventional commits when commiting in git.
This allows both people who are viewing your commits and yourself to understand what the commit was about easier.
Some examples are feat which is for when you are adding a feature, fix for when you are fixing a bug or chore for when you are cleaning up your code or doing something trivial.
If your commit follows mutliple of these conventions, it is recommended to make multiple commits since commits are completly free and that there arnt any downsides of doing multiple commits. Of course overcommiting is not encouraged and these commits should be situationally judged.

The article covers some of the recommended conventions used in writing Git commits. It covers not only terminology but also formatting, attemtping to maximize the number of people who can understand its purpose. Given software development nearly never occurs within in a solitary environment (unless one takes freelancing to the extreme), writing comprehensible commits is vital. 

The continued growth and maturation of the industry brings with it the formalization of practices as projects reach enterprise scales. Dealing with legacy code would therefore become increasingly the norm, and without established practices maintaining them would become extremely difficult (even moreso than even at present).
